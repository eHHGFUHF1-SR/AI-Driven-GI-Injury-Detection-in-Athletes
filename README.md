# Leveraging Large Language Models for Gastrointestinal Injury Detection in Athletes

A medical image analysis and AI-driven framework for the detection, classification, and rehabilitation of gastrointestinal injuries in athletes using deep learning and multimodal data.

---

## Overview

This project introduces an innovative AI-powered solution that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques to enhance gastrointestinal injury detection and rehabilitation monitoring in sports medicine. The system is built around two core components:

- BANNet (Biomechanical-Aware Neural Network): A deep hierarchical model for injury prediction and classification.
- ARPOS (Adaptive Rehabilitation and Performance Optimization Strategy): A personalized recovery framework using reinforcement learning.

---

## Key Features

- Multimodal Data Integration: Medical imaging, biomechanical signals, physiological indicators, and athletic performance metrics.
- Deep Learning-Based Injury Detection: Utilizes spatial-temporal feature extraction for high-accuracy classification.
- Real-Time Adaptive Rehab: Feedback-driven protocol optimization via reinforcement learning.
- Clinical Decision Support: AI-assisted insights for sports physicians and trainers.

## Architecture

### BANNet
- Hierarchical deep neural network.
- Processes spatial (image) and temporal (sensor/biometric) patterns.
- Supports early-stage injury detection with improved sensitivity.

### ARPOS
- Reinforcement Learning agent.
- Adapts rehab plans in real-time based on athlete progress.
- Integrates sensor feedback for dynamic optimization.
